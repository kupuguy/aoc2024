My solutions for the 2024 Advent Of Code puzzles

This code is very much the first thing I thought of to solve each problem. Advent Of Code rarely
rewards code written to solve a problem in the cleanest way: brute force is much more likely
to give an answer quickly, at least for the early problems.

The folder `src/` contains the original scripts I wrote with minor cleanup.

I also use ruff to clean all the input, sometimes after I finished but sometimes mid problem when the code gets too ropey. All code has type annotations but I probably haven't run mypy.

The folder `input` has the puzzle input.
